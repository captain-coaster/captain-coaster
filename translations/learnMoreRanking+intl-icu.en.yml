        "<p>Captain Coaster's ranking is based on a <b>pairwise comparison system</b>. Comparisons are derived from your Tops and Ratings — the more detailed they are, the better!</p>
        <p>Tops are more precise, while ratings are quicker to use. To maximize your influence on the ranking, we recommend you <b>rate all your ridden coasters</b>, then <b>order your highest-rated coasters</b> in your Top.</p>"

        "<p><b>For each coaster in the ranking, we compute a head-to-head duel against every other coaster</b> in the database to determine which one is better.</p>
        <p>Only riders who have experienced both coasters can weigh in on a duel. This comparison comes from rating both coasters or ordering both in your Top. <b>The duel is won by the coaster with the majority of favorable comparisons.</b><br/>The results of all these duels are then combined to produce the final ranking. If a coaster wins all its duels, it takes the #1 spot. A coaster that only loses to #1 but beats everyone else becomes #2, and so on. The score reflects this proportion of duels won.</p>
        <p>The algorithm is designed to <b>reflect the genuine preferences and tastes of all participating riders</b>.<br/>There is no mass effect: the total number of ratings a coaster receives has no influence. This is not a popularity contest! Rare coasters have the same chance of ranking well as the most popular ones.</p>
        <p>For reference: rating just 1 coaster generates 0 comparisons, meaning no influence at all. Rating 10 coasters generates 45 comparisons, rating 20 coasters generates 190 comparisons, and so on.</p>
        <p>The more coasters you ride and rate, the more comparisons you contribute — and the greater your influence on the ranking. This encourages you to rate all your ridden coasters, and to keep riding more!</p>
        <p>Keep in mind that <b>a single person cannot disrupt the entire ranking</b>. Everyone has influence, but one person with a contrarian opinion on a coaster won't drastically change its score — the majority view always prevails.</p>"
